  with:
    # CPU architecture: armv6, armv7, aarch64, riscv64, s390x, ppc64le.
    arch: # optional, default is aarch64
    # Linux distribution name: ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, bullseye, buster, stretch, jessie, fedora_latest, alpine_latest, archarm_latest.
    distro: # optional, default is ubuntu18.04
    # Your GitHub token, used for caching Docker images in your project's public package registry. Usually this would just be $\{{ github.token }}. This speeds up builds and is highly recommended.
    githubToken: # optional, default is 
    # Environment variables to propagate to the container. YAML, but must begin with a | character. These variables will be available in both run and setup.
    env: # optional, default is 
    # Shell commands to execute in the container.
    run: 
    # The shell to run commands with in the container. Default: /bin/sh on alpine (because Alpine uses BusyBox), /bin/bash for other distros.
    shell: # optional, default is 
    # Additional arguments to pass to docker run, such as volume mappings. See README for example usage.
    dockerRunArgs: # optional
    # Shell commands to execute on the host before running the container, such as creating directories for volume mappings. See README for example usage.
    setup: # optional, default is 
    # Shell commands to execute in the container as part of docker build, such as installing dependencies. This speeds up subsequent builds if githubToken is also used, but note that the image layer will be publicly available in your projects GitHub Package Registry, so make sure the resulting image does not have any secrets cached in logs or state.
    install: # optional, default is 
    # Specify a custom base image, such as \"busybox\" or your predefined base image. This will replace the \"FROM\" claus in the default Dockerfile on the fly. This is optional. Hint: with this option you are able to use all the available archs other than the ones showed by default. See the [advanced example](./.github/workflows/advanced-example.yml) in this repo. For more detials, see [PR #103](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/pull/103#issuecomment-1363810049).
